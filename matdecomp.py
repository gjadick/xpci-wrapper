Code originally written and tested with:
numpy 1.14.3
Python 3.6


How to use:
    Call spbi_material_basis to perform phase retrieval
    Call adjust_delta to manage rare insabilities with certain delta/beta values

def spbi_material_basis(images, distances, px, ds, mus):
    """Spectral phase retrieval using a material basis to model the sample.
    The linearised TIE without crossterm is inverted directly. The algorithm
    returns the projected thicknesses for both materials. If more than two
    images are provided, the least-squares solution is calculated.

    - Any combination of materials and images at any energy/distance
      combinations are possible.
    - Generally, any third material can be expressed as a linear
      combination of the first two materials unless there are k-edge
      involved.
    - Multiple materials typically requires a change in energy for a stable
      algorithm. The number of different measurements should be the same or
      more than the number of materials.

    Parameters
    ----------
    images : list of 2-d arrays / 3-d array
        input images containing the measurements without log taken. Can be any
        number of images >= 2
    distances : float or list of floats
        propagation distances [m]. Can either be a single float if the same
        propagation distance is used for all measurements, or a list of same
        length as the number of images
    px : float
        detector pixel size of the measurements
    ds, mus : 2-d array
        delta and mu values to be used. Different energies along the first
        axis, different materials along the second axis.

    Returns
    ----------
    out : TR
        phase retrieved thicknesses for the different materials
